Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client known as The Gaming Room were game developers who wanted me to design software to allow more than one team to play their game as well as making game and team names unique. The other main factor was that they wanted their game to be developed on multiple OS such as Apple and Windows as well as even mobile devices. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What I felt that I did partiualrly well was the explanation of the Domain Model. The UML diagram is a key factor in developing the code so being able to read and understand how it is written can greatly help me work on the code needed to run the program.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document really helped me plan out any ideas and implementations that needed to be done as per the clients wants. Especially the beginning with understanding the executive summary and then the design constraints. Then with the UML diagram all three of those helped pieced everything together.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The part I would like to revise the most would be the Evaluation documents as I felt that I really missed the point with these especially with comparing and contrasting the different kinds of OS for development. I would go back and do some more research into each of the pros and cons so that I understand them mucn more. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users needs as what they specifically wanted done for the software design. I had their summary and design constraints explained in the beginning. It is very important to understand what the needs are of the user as you are developing this software for them and their company even. You have to becareful and make sure you are working to their best interests.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software as I would any other kind of project that I would be making for another user. As per understanding what the needs were of the user and making sure I had everything they wanted or needed clearly so I could implement it. As it pertains to designing the actual software I relied on Object-Oriented Design in order to create and tweak the software as needed. Going back to the UML diagram I knew what my main classes were and what needed to be implemented inside the classes so that the program would function as intended. I hope to do the same in a future design document so that I can implement the classes as it pertains to the diagrams presented.
